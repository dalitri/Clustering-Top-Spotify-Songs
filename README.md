# Clustering-Top-Spotify-Songs

Spotifyâ€™s platform revolutionized music listening forever
when it launched in 2008. Spotify's move into
podcasting brought innovation and a new generation of
listeners to the medium, and in 2022 Spotify entered the
next audio market primed for growth with the addition
of audiobooks.

In today's era, there are many platforms to listen to
music. Therefore, it is important to improve user
experience and engagement by providing personalized
song recommendations (in this project specifically in the
rock genre).
By clustering songs based on user preferences and
characteristics, platforms can offer customized playlists
and recommendations, thereby increasing user
satisfaction and retention.
