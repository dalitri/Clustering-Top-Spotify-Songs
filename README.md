# Clustering-Top-Spotify-Songs

In today's era, there are many platforms to listen to
music. Therefore, it is important to improve user
experience and engagement by providing personalized
song recommendations (in this project specifically in the
rock genre).
By clustering songs based on user preferences and
characteristics, platforms can offer customized playlists
and recommendations, thereby increasing user
satisfaction and retention.

Clustering in this project is done using the clustering ML model (KMeans). 
In this project, the spotify dataset is used.
